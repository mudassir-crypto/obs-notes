PassRole:
* Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to the service, instead of creating a new service-linked role.
* To do this, a user must have permissions to _pass the role_ to the service.

#### AWS Organisation
![[IAM14.jpg]]
* A root is a top-level parent node in the hierarchy of an organization that can contain organizational units (OUs) and accounts. The root contains every AWS account in the organization.
* An _organizational unit (OU)_ is a group of AWS accounts in an organization. An OU can also contain other OUs enabling you to create a hierarchy. For example, you can group all accounts that belong to the same department into a departmental OU. Similarly, you can group all accounts running security services into a security OU

* Reduces admin overhead
* Consolidation of reservation and volume discounts
* Can create AWS account within AWS Organisation

Can switch between accounts by assuming roles

#### Service Control Policy (SCP)
![[IAM17.jpg]]

* Feature of AWS Organizations which allow restrictions to be placed on MEMBER accounts in the form of boundaries.
* SCPs can be applied to the organization, to OU's or to individual accounts.
* SCP does not work on *master or management* account
* SCPs DON'T GIVE permission - they just control what an account CAN and CANNOT grant via identity policies.

AWS Organizations attaches an AWS managed SCP named **FullAWSAccess** to every root, OU and account when it's created. This policy allows all services and actions. You can replace **FullAWSAccess** with a policy allowing only a set of services so that new AWS services are not allowed unless they are explicitly allowed by updating SCPs. For example, if your organization wants to only allow the use of a subset of services in your environment, you can use an `Allow` statement to only allow specific services.
