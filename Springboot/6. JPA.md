ORM is a technique that lets us interact with a database using objects in programming language instead of writing raw SQL.

It automatically maps database tables → to classes, and rows → to objects.

One liner: "ORM is a way to map Java objects to database tables so that developers can work with objects instead of SQL queries. Hibernate is a popular ORM framework in Java."

Example:  
Without ORM:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

With ORM (in Java using JPA/Hibernate):
```java
User user = userRepository.findById(1L).get();
```

JPA is a specification — it defines how Java objects should map to database tables, but it doesn’t provide the actual implementation. Hibernate is one of the most popular implementations of JPA. In other words, JPA is the set of rules, and Hibernate is the tool that follows those rules to do the actual work.

JPA → Interface / Specification (What to do)
Hibernate → Implementation / Tool (How to do it)
