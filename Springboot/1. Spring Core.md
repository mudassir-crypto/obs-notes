Spring Framework is a powerful, lightweight framework used for building Java applications. It's modular, meaning it's made up of several modules that you can use independently or together, depending on your project's needs. The main modules are:  

![[springcore1.jpg]]
#####  1. Spring Core Container  
Core, Beans, Context, and Expression Language (SpEL).  
Provides the foundation of Spring, including Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).  
Example: When we use @Component, @Autowired, or XML-based configuration, it comes from this module.  
##### 2. Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)  
Helps in separating cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or transaction management.  
Example: You can log method execution without changing the actual code using @Aspect.  
##### 3. Spring Data Access / Integration  
Modules like JDBC, ORM, JPA, and Transaction management.  
Simplifies database operations by eliminating boilerplate code.  
Example: With JdbcTemplate or Spring Data JPA, you can perform DB operations with minimal code.  
##### 4. Spring Web Module  
Supports Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller).  
Used to build web applications and RESTful services.  
Example: Creating REST APIs using @RestController, @RequestMapping.  
##### 5. Spring Security  
Provides authentication and authorization.  
Example: Restrict access to URLs or secure APIs with roles.  
##### 6. Spring Boot (technically a separate project, but commonly used)  
Simplifies Spring configuration with auto-configuration and embedded servers.  
Example: Just add dependencies and Spring Boot will auto-configure your app (e.g., DB, security, etc.).  
##### 7. Spring Testing  
Supports integration with JUnit and TestNG.  
Provides annotations like @SpringBootTest for testing Spring components.  
  
How to explain in an interview: "Spring is modular, so we use only what we need. For example, in our project, we used the Core container for dependency injection, Spring MVC for REST APIs, Spring Data JPA for database operations, and Spring Security for securing endpoints. Spring Boot helped us get started quickly with minimal configuration."

#### Tight vs Loose Coupling

Tight Coupling  
* When one class is highly dependent on another class.  
* Changes in one class will likely require changes in the other.   
* Hard to test, maintain, or extend.
```java
class Engine {  
	void start() {  
		System.out.println("Engine started");  
	}  
}  
  
class Car {  
	Engine engine = new Engine(); // tight coupling  
  
	void drive() {  
		engine.start();  
	}  
}
```
Here, Car creates the Engine object itself, so it’s tightly coupled. If we change Engine or want a different engine type, we have to modify Car.


Loose Coupling  
* Classes are independent and interact through abstractions (interfaces).  
* Easier to maintain, test, and extend.  
* Achieved using Dependency Injection in Spring.
```java
interface Engine {  
	void start();  
}  
  
class DieselEngine implements Engine {  
	public void start() {  
		System.out.println("Diesel Engine started");  
	}  
}  
  
class Car {  
	private Engine engine;  
  
	// constructor injection  
	Car(Engine engine) {  
		this.engine = engine;  
	}  
  
	void drive() {  
		engine.start();  
	}  
}
```
Now, Car is loosely coupled with Engine – any engine type can be injected without changing Car.
Spring promotes loose coupling using Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI).

##### Beans and dependency management
![[springcore2.jpg]]

About the beans => @Component
About dependencies => @Autowired
Where to search for beans => @ComponentScan
eg. @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.core.springcore", "test"})

#### Ambiguity:
`@Primary` and `@Qualifier` are annotations used to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are available for dependency injection

##### `@Primary`
- **Purpose**: Marks a bean as the default choice when multiple candidates are present.
- used on Class

##### `@Qualifier`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the exact bean to inject when there are multiple candidates.
- used on bean

```java
@Compenent("cat)
// @Primary
class Cat implements Animal {

}

@Compenent("dog")
class Dog implements Animal {

}

@Component
class Person {

	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("cat")
	Animal animal;

// if using on constructor
	@Autowired

	public Person(@Qualifier("dog") Animal animal) {
		this.animal = animal;
	}
}

context.getBean("cat", Animal.class)
```

@Component("cat") => @Component @Qualifier("cat") //same thing

#### Different ways of injection
![[springcore3.jpg]]

```java
1 - Constructor injection
@Component
class Person {

3 - Field injection
@Autowired
Animal animal;

	@Autowired
	public Person(Animal animal) {
		System.out.println("autowired const()");
		this.animal = animal;
	}

2 - Setter injection
	@Autowired
	public void setAnimal(Animal animal) {
		System.out.println("setting animal");
		this.animal = animal;
	}
}
```

We're applying all 3 injection but use only 1 and comment the other injection

If mandatory then use constructor injection
If option then use setter injection
