The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network.

#### 1. Physical
* It is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel, such as a wire, cable, or wireless signal.
* This layer defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium, including voltage levels, cable types, and signaling methods, to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and reliably between devices.

#### 2. Data Link
* It is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between two nodes on the same network segment.
* This layer defines protocols for the access and use of the physical network, such as addressing, flow control, error detection and correction.

Layer 2 as a hub:
After all device receive the same frame, it checks the destination header and will keep the frame if it matches with device.
